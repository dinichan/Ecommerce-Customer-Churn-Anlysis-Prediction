# Ecommerce-Customer-Churn-Anlysis-Prediction
Final Project for diBimbing.id BI Bootcamp


This is my master piece for the diBimbing.id business intelligence bootcamp.
In this project, I will predict customer churn for The Look Ecommerce, an ecommerce that sells fashion items.
The data set that I use is publicly available on BigQuery Public Dataset.


This project will be divided into three parts:

- Churn Labeling 
- Churn Prediction - 
- Model Assessment & Implementation


Here, I attempt to combine several aspects of data analysis, starting with extracting data sets using SQL (BigQuery SQL), moving on to handling large data sets, modeling, and finally evaluating and implementing models in the company's business.


I hope the project and notebook can serve as a resource, and I appreciate any input or collaboration.
